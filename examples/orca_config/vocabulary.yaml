SignalMixin:
  definition: |
    A mixin class that generates trading signals (BUY, SELL, HOLD) based on
    market data. SignalMixins are composable components that can be combined
    to create complex trading strategies.
  examples:
    - "MomentumSignalMixin - generates signals based on price momentum"
    - "MeanReversionSignalMixin - signals when price deviates from moving average"
    - "VolumeSignalMixin - incorporates volume analysis into signals"
  see_also:
    - FeatureMixin
    - Strategy

FeatureMixin:
  definition: |
    A mixin class that computes derived features from raw market data.
    Features are used by SignalMixins to make trading decisions. FeatureMixins
    handle the data transformation and ensure proper time-series alignment.
  examples:
    - "RSIFeatureMixin - computes Relative Strength Index"
    - "BollingerFeatureMixin - computes Bollinger Bands"
    - "VWAPFeatureMixin - computes Volume Weighted Average Price"
  see_also:
    - SignalMixin
    - DataPipeline

Strategy:
  definition: |
    A complete trading strategy composed of one or more SignalMixins and
    FeatureMixins. Strategies inherit from BaseStrategy and combine mixins
    to define entry/exit logic.
  examples:
    - "class MomentumStrategy(BaseStrategy, MomentumSignalMixin, RSIFeatureMixin)"

DataPipeline:
  definition: |
    The system for loading, cleaning, and transforming market data. Handles
    multiple data sources, missing data, and ensures consistent timestamps.

Position:
  definition: |
    A current holding in a security. Tracks quantity, entry price, P&L, and
    associated orders.

Order:
  definition: |
    A request to buy or sell a security. Can be market, limit, or stop orders.
    Orders flow through the OrderManager to the broker.

Backtest:
  definition: |
    Historical simulation of a strategy's performance. Uses past market data
    to evaluate strategy returns, drawdown, and risk metrics.

LiveRunner:
  definition: |
    The system that executes strategies in real-time with live market data
    and real broker connections.

RiskManager:
  definition: |
    Component that enforces position limits, stop-losses, and other risk
    constraints. Can veto or modify orders before execution.

lookahead_bias:
  definition: |
    A bug where future data is accidentally used to make decisions about the
    past. Common in backtesting when features use data that wouldn't have
    been available at execution time.
  examples:
    - "Using tomorrow's close to make today's trading decision"
    - "Fitting parameters on the full dataset including test period"
